# IGEN Hired

### To get started
Once you've cloned the folder,
1. Hit `npm i` to install the repo's dependencies
2. Go to the `backend` folder to learn how to set up the backend. Come back here when you're done.
3. Once that's done, run `npm run dev` in your terminal. This should get the server and the client running.
  - The server lives at `localhost:5000`
  - The client lives at `localhost:3000`
  
 If you're confused about anything, go to `TUTORIAL.md`
